Getting Started
===============

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) 4.0.0 or higher

2. Add an [editor plugin](http://elm-lang.org/install#syntax-highlighting) for your editor of choice.

3. Not required, but **highly** recommended: [install elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#installation-) and integrate it into your editor so that it runs on save.

4. Run the following command to install everything else:

```bash
npm install -g elm@0.16.0 elm-live@2.0.4 elm-test@0.16.1-alpha3 elm-css@0.4.0
```

This command could take several minutes to complete.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-workshop.git
cd elm-workshop
```

## Start with Stage 1
